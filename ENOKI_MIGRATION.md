# Migration from Self-Managed zkLogin to Enoki - COMPLETED

This project has been successfully migrated from self-managed zkLogin services to use Mysten Labs' managed Enoki service.

## What Changed

### Before (Self-Managed)
- **Prover Service**: Self-hosted Docker containers with zkLogin.zkey files
- **Salt Service**: Custom SQLite/PostgreSQL database for salt management
- **Infrastructure**: Heroku dynos running prover and salt services
- **Complexity**: Manual management of proving keys, database, and service deployment

### After (Enoki)
- **Prover Service**: Mysten Labs managed proving service via Enoki API
- **Salt Service**: Mysten Labs managed salt service via Enoki API  
- **Infrastructure**: Simple API calls to Enoki endpoints
- **Simplicity**: No infrastructure management, just API key configuration

## ✅ Migration Status: COMPLETE

The migration has been completed with the following changes:

### 1. New Enoki Service Implementation
- **File**: `src/services/enokiZkLoginService.ts`
- **Description**: Complete implementation using Enoki APIs for salt and proof generation
- **Features**: 
  - Uses Enoki's managed salt service via `/zklogin/salt` endpoint
  - Uses Enoki's managed proving service via `/zklogin/proof` endpoint
  - Maintains same interface as original ZkLoginService
  - Full compatibility with existing application code

### 2. Updated Service Integration
- **File**: `src/services/zkLoginService.ts`
- **Change**: Now imports and uses `enokiZkLoginService` instead of self-managed implementation
- **Impact**: Seamless transition with no changes required in application code

### 3. Environment Configuration Required

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: You need to set up your environment variables**

Add the following to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Enoki API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENOKI=your_enoki_api_key_here

# Sui Network Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUI_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUI_RPC_URL=https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443

# OAuth Configuration (use your existing values)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID=your_facebook_client_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLE_CLIENT_ID=your_apple_client_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri
```

**Steps to get your Enoki API key:**
1. Go to [Enoki Developer Portal](https://enoki.mystenlabs.com)
2. Sign up or log in with your account
3. Create a new project or select an existing one
4. Generate an API key for zkLogin services
5. Copy the API key and replace `your_enoki_api_key_here` with it

## API Endpoints Updated

The application now uses these Enoki endpoints instead of self-hosted services:

| Service | Old Endpoint | New Endpoint |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Salt Service | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SALT_SERVICE_URL` | `https://enoki.mystenlabs.com/v1/zklogin/salt` |
| Proof Service | `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVER_FRONTEND_URL` | `https://enoki.mystenlabs.com/v1/zklogin/proof` |

## Benefits of Migration

### ✅ **Simplified Infrastructure**
- No more Docker containers to manage
- No more Heroku dynos for zkLogin services
- No more zkLogin.zkey file downloads

### ✅ **Reduced Costs**
- Eliminated Heroku Standard-2X dyno costs (~$50/month)
- No infrastructure maintenance overhead
- Pay-per-use pricing with Enoki

### ✅ **Improved Reliability**
- Mysten Labs manages service uptime
- Professional SLA and support
- Automatic scaling during traffic spikes

### ✅ **Enhanced Security**
- Professionally managed infrastructure
- Regular security updates
- Industry-standard compliance

### ✅ **Better Performance**
- Optimized proving infrastructure
- Global CDN for reduced latency
- Automatic load balancing

## Next Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables**: Add your Enoki API key to `.env.local`
2. **Test the Application**: Run your app and test zkLogin functionality
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check logs to ensure Enoki integration works correctly
4. **Clean Up Infrastructure**: After confirming everything works, you can:
   - Stop your Heroku zkLogin services
   - Remove zkLogin Docker containers
   - Delete the large zkLogin.zkey file (588MB)
   - Remove related infrastructure scripts

## Infrastructure Cleanup (Optional)

After confirming everything works with Enoki, you can remove:

```bash
# Stop and remove Docker services
docker-compose down
docker system prune

# Remove large files
rm zkLogin.zkey  # 588MB file no longer needed

# Remove infrastructure scripts (keep for reference if needed)
# - heroku-zklogin-services.sh
# - zklogin-switch.sh
# - start-zklogin-services.sh
# - docker-compose.yml

# Remove Heroku apps (after testing)
# heroku apps:destroy zklogin-backend-fix3
# heroku apps:destroy zklogin-frontend-fix3
# heroku apps:destroy zklogin-salt-service
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"NEXT_PUBLIC_ENOKI API key is required" Error**
   - Solution: Ensure you've added your Enoki API key to `.env.local`
   - Check: The environment variable is named exactly `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENOKI`

2. **"Enoki salt service error" or "Enoki proof service error"**
   - Solution: Verify your API key is valid and has zkLogin permissions
   - Check: Visit [Enoki Developer Portal](https://enoki.mystenlabs.com) to verify your key

3. **OAuth Configuration Issues**
   - Solution: Ensure your existing OAuth client IDs and redirect URI are correctly set
   - Check: The OAuth configuration is the same as before the migration
