# Njangi Rotational Circle Smart Contract

## Overview
Njangi is a decentralized implementation of the classic Rotational Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA).  
Members contribute a fixed amount of stable-value tokens each cycle, and the pooled funds are paid out to one member per cycle following a predefined rotation order.  
All logic is enforced on-chain by a Move smart contract deployed to the Sui blockchain.

## Why Rotational Circles?
‚Ä¢ Simple, time-tested community finance model.  
‚Ä¢ Guaranteed payout once per cycle for every member.  
‚Ä¢ Transparent treasury‚Äîevery deposit, payout and penalty is publicly auditable on Sui.  
‚Ä¢ Automated enforcement removes the need for an off-chain treasurer.

## Core Workflow
1. **Create Circle** ‚Äì The creator defines: contribution amount, total members, payout order and cycle duration.  
2. **Join Circle** ‚Äì Prospective members submit a security deposit plus their first contribution.  
3. **Cycle Contributions** ‚Äì During each cycle every member deposits the fixed amount before the deadline.  
4. **Automated Payout** ‚Äì At cycle close the contract automatically transfers the pooled balance to that cycle's designated recipient.  
5. **Completion** ‚Äì After the final cycle, security deposits are released (minus any penalties) and the circle is closed.

## Contract Interface (Move)
```move
public fun create_circle(
    name: vector<u8>,
    contribution_amount: u64,
    cycle_duration: u64,          // seconds
    payout_order: vector<address>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
): (NjangiCircle, AdminCap);

public fun join_circle(
    circle: &mut NjangiCircle,
    security_deposit: Coin<USDC>,
    first_contribution: Coin<USDC>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
);

public fun make_contribution(
    circle: &mut NjangiCircle,
    payment: Coin<USDC>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
);

public fun claim_payout(
    circle: &mut NjangiCircle,
    ctx: &mut TxContext
);
```
*The actual contract contains additional helper functions and event emitters; see `/move/sources/` for full code.*

## Security Deposits & Upcoming Yield
Security deposits protect the circle against missed contributions.  
We are integrating a staking module that will deploy these deposits to a DeFi yield source while they remain locked, allowing members to earn extra rewards.  
Stay tuned for details in a future release.

## Development Quick-Start
```bash
# Compile smart contract
cd move && sui move build

# Run Move unit tests
sui move test -p .
```
Front-end, API and automated scripts live under `web/` and `scripts/` directories.

## Roadmap
- üîÑ Yield-bearing security deposits (staking integration)  
- üì± zkLogin authentication for seamless Web3 onboarding  
- üåê Multicurrency support & automatic stablecoin swaps  
- üõ°Ô∏è Formal verification of critical contract invariants
